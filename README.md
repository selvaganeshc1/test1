Shopify Application Development
--------------------

This repository is the source code for the book _Shopify Application Development_ by Michael Larkin (me):

[http://www.packtpub.com/shopify-application-development/book](http://www.packtpub.com/shopify-application-development/book)


Usage
--------------------
The application is meant as a teaching tool rather than as a viable commerical application, and please treat it as such.  The code is released under the MIT license.

Structure
--------------------
This is a Rails 4 app, and I'm not doing anything too fancy.

You will find the source code for each chapter in a separate branch. Feel free to fork the repo and play around as you wish!

Errata
--------------------
At the time of publication, the code has been tested by a few different people.  However, if you spot a bug in the code feel free to report it!
